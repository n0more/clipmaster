# ClipMaster

ClipMaster is a lightweight and efficient clipboard manager for macOS. It runs in the menu bar, keeping a history of everything you copy, so you can quickly find and reuse it.

## Features

- **Clipboard History**: Automatically saves a history of text and images you copy.
- **Menu Bar Access**: Lives in your menu bar for quick access without cluttering your Dock.
- **Hotkey Popup**: Instantly access your clipboard history from anywhere with a global hotkey (`Control + Shift + K`). The history window appears right under your cursor.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Navigate your history using arrow keys and press `Enter` to copy an item back to your clipboard.
- **Image Support**: Previews images directly in the history view.
