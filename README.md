ClipMaster is more than just a clipboard history. It's a native macOS tool that lets you instantly process copied text using your own locally running AI models.

## Key Features

*   **Clipboard History**: Access your recently copied items through a convenient panel, summoned by a hotkey.
*   **Ollama Integration**: Connects to your local Ollama server to process text.
*   **Custom Prompts**: Create, edit, and save your own prompts for quick text transformations (e.g., "Translate to English," "Fix grammar," "Rewrite in a professional tone").
*   **Flexible Configuration**:
    *   Set any URL for your Ollama API (local or network).
    *   Choose from any of your available Ollama models.
    *   Adjust the model's "temperature" to control response creativity.
*   **Native Experience**: Built with SwiftUI for a lightweight, fast, and seamless macOS experience.
*   **Menu Bar Access**: Lives in your menu bar for quick access to settings and features.
